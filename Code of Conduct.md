# Code of Conduct
**TL;DR.** Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an MLH Member Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.

We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.  

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Hackathoneando may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.
